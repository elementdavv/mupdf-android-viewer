## New Features
- <img src="resources/flip_vertical.png"> Vertical Flip

  The most popular reading mode.

- <img src="resources/text_left.png"> Read Reversal

  In general, words in a book run from left to right, lines top to down and pages left to right. There is an exception in some Japanese and traditional Chinese books where words run from top to down, lines right to left and pages right to left. **Read Reversal** mode can be applied to this kind of books.

- <img src="resources/single_column.png"> Single Column

  Some PDF books were scanned in a way that left and right pages were put in one image, resulting in a so called dual-spread page. In the scenario, **Single Column** mode plays a role. It splits a dual-spread page into two pages.

  In **Single Column** mode, all pages except first and last page are splitted.

  The **Single Column** button will show up on **WIDE** pages which means page width is longer than page height.

- Continuous scroll

  **Continuous scroll** is another must have feature for a book reader. It has been perfectly implemented in all scenarios.

- <img src="resources/lock.png"> Lock Stray

  When flinging or scrolling a zoomed page, it can hardly move in straight horizontal / vertical direction, and be annoying reading experience. Here the **Lock Stray** mode will make a help.

- <img src="resources/crop_margin.png"> Crop Margin

  Crop page margins to get more efficient reading space. All document types are supported.

- <img src="resources/focus.png"> Focus

  **Focus** mode can retent page display position across zoomed pages. When page flips. it presents visible content area of new page in same position as the old one.

  On entering **Focus** mode, current page will zoom automatically to match screen in shorter dimension and center itself in screen.

- <img src="resources/smart_focus.png"> Smart Focus

  For scanned PDF books, content area scarcely appear exactly centered in a page. More probable it inclines toward left or right side. **Smart Focus** deals with the scenario. By adjusting the position of even or odd pages accordingly, it makes **Focus** mode behave smartly.

  **Smart Focus** must work with **Focus** mode to make sense.

- <img src="resources/format.png"> Font size

  Current font size is indicated in **Font Size** menu.

  The **Font Size** button only appear in Epub, Mobi, or Fb2 documents.

- <img src="resources/toc.png"> Table of Contents

  **Table of Contents** supports multi-level headings, and headings collapsing / expanding.

  The **Table of Contents** button only appear when the document has one.

- Scrollable Toobar

  The top toolbar is made scrollable to accommodate more buttons, and the buttons will show up when available.
